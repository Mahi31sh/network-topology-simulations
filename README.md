Cisco Packet Tracer – Network Topologies

This repository contains my networking activity projects created using Cisco Packet Tracer. The objective of this work is to design and simulate basic network topologies, helping to understand how devices are connected and how data flows within a network.

Topologies Implemented

Star Topology – All devices are connected to a central switch or hub. This makes it easy to manage and expand, but if the central device fails, the entire network is affected.

Mesh Topology – Every device is interconnected, offering multiple paths for communication. This provides high reliability and fault tolerance, but requires more cabling and configuration.

Purpose of the Project

The project was developed as part of a Computer Networks activity to gain hands-on experience in building, analyzing, and comparing different types of network topologies. By working with these simulations, I was able to:

Learn how to use Cisco Packet Tracer effectively.

Explore the strengths and weaknesses of different network designs.

Understand how topology affects performance, reliability, and scalability.

Project Contents

This repository includes two .pkt simulation files:

Star Topology.pkt

Mesh Topology.pkt

Each file can be opened in Cisco Packet Tracer to visualize and run the network simulations.
